This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: attempting to install dependencies from a missing requirements.txt file.  The initial Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`) contains this error, leading to a build failure.  The solution (`Dockerfile_solution.txt`) provides a corrected Dockerfile that includes the necessary requirements.txt file and demonstrates proper dependency management.
